# Running Object detection and Semantic segmentation parallely

[Bug raised](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/53834) - Trying to run object detection and semantic segmentation on TF at the same time.


### Note
If you wish to run this gist against TF 2.7.0, make changes by uncommenting the required lines in the files `run_SS_model.py` and `run_two_models.py`

Look out for this hint -> `#Uncomment if you are using TF2` and make sure you also comment the lines for TF 1.15
